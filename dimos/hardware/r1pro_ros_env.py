"""ROS 2 environment setup for Galaxea R1 Pro communication.

The R1 Pro robot runs ROS 2 Humble with FastDDS on a Jetson Orin at
192.168.123.150.  The DimOS laptop runs Jazzy.  To bridge the two
ROS 2 versions reliably we must:

  1. Use FastDDS (rmw_fastrtps_cpp) on both ends — CycloneDDS has
     EDP incompatibilities across Humble/Jazzy.
  2. Use a unicast peer list instead of multicast so discovery works
     across the ethernet link.
  3. Set the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID on both sides.

Call ``ensure_r1pro_ros_env()`` **before** any ``RawROS.start()``
or ``rclpy.init()`` — environment variables must be set before the
RMW is initialised.
